    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",

       "         'These days, when a person says, \"chicken soup\" they\\'re probably going to follow up those words with, \"for the soul\" or maybe \"for the teenaged soul\".  Didn\\'t used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak\\'s catchy 1962 children\\'s book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn\\'t dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak\\'s other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It\\'s a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there\\'s robin\\'s nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child\\'s reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you\\'re just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven\\'t found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you\\'re missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin\\' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It\\'s Sendak at his finest.': 1,\n",

It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA.

With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll': 1,\n",

       "         'Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It\\'s the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don\\'t like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O\\'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte\\'s \"Banana Boat Song\" (\"Day-O\"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />The extras announced are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (\"Skeletons in the Closet,\" \"Spooky Boo-tique,\" \"A-Ha!\"), a music-only track, the trailer and, according to the press release but not the Warners Brothers web page for this DVD, an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but that would be unusual and I wouldn\\'t count on it.

       "         \"Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.\": 1,\n",

Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts.

After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\": 1,\n",

They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm\\'s menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman\\'s theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O\\'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you\\'ll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he\\'s one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).': 1,\n",

       "         'Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton\\'s best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially \"trapped\" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house\\'s new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don\\'t mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It\\'s definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present \"uniqueness\" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the \"afterlife\" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It\\'s one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There\\'s a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren\\'t that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars).': 1,\n",

Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he\\'s waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as \"The Recently Deceased.\"  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it\\'s not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it\\'s more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don\\'t worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?)

After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.

The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O\\'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker\\'s death-obsessed daughter, Lydia).

There are very few dark farces as comically twisted as this delightful romp through the afterlife, and none with a more hilarious lead anywhere.

       "         \"Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema.\": 1,\n",

Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance \"bio-exorcist\" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn\\'t much help. Adam and Barbara\\'s irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it\\'s a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn\\'t know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte\\'s catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands\\' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder\\'s appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only \"house guest\" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O\\'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let\\'s face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it\\'s her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse\\'s getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes\\' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton\\'s awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE\\'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton\\'s bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There\\'s a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film\\'s offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: \"A-Ha!\", \"Skeletons in the Closet,\" & \"Spooky Boo-tique\"<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE\\'S BIG ADVENTURE': 1,\n",

       "         \"I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\": 1,\n",

The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That\\'s about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.

       "         \"At the time of its release in 1988, 'Beetlejuice' was a huge hit. Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"Beetlejuice is an awe-inspiring wonderfully amusing comedic romp that explores the incredible possibilities of the after-life and the boundaries of the absurd. Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.\": 1,\n",

A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.

       "         'Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It\\'s the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don\\'t like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O\\'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte\\'s \"Banana Boat Song\" (\"Day-O\"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.

I\\'ve subtracted one star for the poor features in a \"deluxe\" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.

       "         \"Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.\": 1,\n",

Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton\\'s twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn\\'t be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80\\'s. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of \"production notes\" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn\\'t gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam\\'s Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more.

       "         'Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn\\'t we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It\\'s really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother\\'s horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don\\'t quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled \"Guidebook for the Recently Deceased.\" They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn\\'t seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but \"went out on his own.\" He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven\\'t gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he\\'s an alien. It\\'s hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice\\'s attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It\\'s a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.': 1,\n",
       "         \"When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.\": 1,\n",

Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy.\": 1,\n",

Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus.

Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O\\'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).<br /><br />One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte\\'s Banana Boat song `Day-O\\'.

With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the \\'90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O\\'Hara\\'s comedic talents in this movie. Now, she\\'s my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a \"haunted house\" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn\\'t surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife.

They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.

       "         'I\\'ve been using mole traps of this kind for over 50 years and have killed many hundreds of moles.  I have used Victor traps and cheaper traps.  They all kill moles but I prefer Victor because of the design.  The \"legs\" that hold the trap in the ground have barbs on them to keep the trap from jumping out of the ground when the trap is triggered.  The trap is made from heavy guage steel and the spikes are heavy guage and very sharp.  The spikes are sharpened diagonally on the tips so they cut like a knife.  The trap is easy to set.....takes just a couple minutes, just follow the simple directions.  If people are missing moles with this trap, it is probably because they are not setting the trap in deep enough or are not making sure the spikes can travel freely down into the ground when the trap is sprung.  A couple of tips:  After locating the run, step on a spot to flatten the run, then set the trap to straddle the flattened run.  Push the \"legs\" of the trap into the dirt as far as they will go until the trigger touches the flattened part of the run that you stepped on.  Then (important)before you set the tripping mechanism, push the spikes up and down through the dirt a few times until they travel freely.  I have caught several moles this week and will get another one this evening.  This mole trap is well-made (in USA), easy to use and will definitely kill moles if it is set correctly.  I have 9 traps and set them in clusters but you can kill many moles with just one trap...........it just takes longer.': 1,\n",

GREAT product.<br /><br />The previous reviewers don\\'t understand that you\\'re not really trying to \"trap\" the mole with the spikes. In all likelihood you will maim the mole and he will go off to die. You won\\'t really know whether you got him until you notice that no new tunnels are being built. And you do need to pay attention to your yard before setting the trap. Figure out where the mole likes to travel by flattening his tunnels and watching where they reappear.

Easiest way to kill them I found is to get a 5gal bucket, fill it with water and throw them in with the trap and all. They sink to the bottom and die pretty quick.

       "         'Picked up a set of 2 at the local home improvement store for ~$11.  The design of this trap seems to count on the animal pushing dirt in front of him and the dirt is what sets off the trap.  In these instances, the gopher will likely be caught behind the neck or shoulders.  I see a lot of holes on our property where the hole is not plugged and plenty of sign that he has been out scampering around.  In these cases, he\\'ll get caught in the hip area with his nose up against where the trigger plate would be set.  This just makes it a little more awkward in emptying the trap.  The cinch type trap looks to be just as effective but much easier to empty.  The cinch trap will cost up to 2-3 times more, though.  I might get one or two cinch traps, but 9/10 will be the 610 type.<br /><br />I have read at least one review where the sweep of the jaws could be an issue, preventing the trap from being seated in small holes and from closing effectively.  This is really easy to work around.  I first thought to shorten the jaws, but decided to just make the hole bigger when setting it.  I learned that gophers are not shy of these traps or your activity around the hole.  In very short order you can excavate the hole to a size that allows the trap to operate freely...and the gopher will come...especially if you notice fresh activity around the hole.<br /><br />Much of the literature on setting traps recommends digging back from the plugged hole to access the main tunnel and then set the traps in pairs so the gopher has to enter a trap from either direction in order to replug the hole.  I have found this is not really necessary.  If the hole I am working was freshly plugged, one trap in the hole works every time.<br /><br />I also noticed that a small plug doesn\\'t necessarily mean a small gopher.  In one instance, I almost passed on setting a trap in what I thought was just going to be wasted effort.  I cleared dirt from a plug the size of a 50 cent piece and it opened up into a tunnel about 2 1/2 inches!  The gopher I got out of that hole was a normal sized gopher!<br /><br />I also read that a 3 degree difference in the gopher\\'s comfort zone in the burrow is enough to cause him to do something about it.  The fact that light appears at a point he previously plugged is also enough for him to quickly come back and see what happened.  One the first day I used these, I set one, then walked about 30 yards away and set another.  I checked the first one on the way back a few minutes later and found it had been tripped and completely covered.  I had to dig it out and found the little bugger had pushed a rock the size of a bird\\'s egg into it!  My first catch was a rock!  A Bill Murray moment flashed through my mind.  That gopher is now history, by the way.<br /><br />I am working with only 2 traps at the moment and secure them with a piece of butcher twine to my tunnel probe or a 12\" piece of 1/4 in re-bar.  This size hardware is probably overkill.  You can probably tie the traps to those marking flags on wire type stems available at your local home improvement store, especially if you are setting a lot of traps.  They may not need to be secured at all.  When that gopher\\'s body in in the trap, he isn\\'t really going anywhere.  If he can go anywhere with it, it might be best to let THAT gopher keep it as a souvenir!<br /><br />If you are not having any success at all with these traps, it would be a good idea to re-examine how and where the traps are being set.  I have never used these things before and only bought this set after 4 years of poison pellets simply didn\\'t work.  Look for FRESH activity and don\\'t be shy about providing enough room for these traps to work.  So far, have set these only at holes that have been plugged, but will set the next time where there is fresh sign but no plug.  I don\\'t bait mine and the trigger plate can ALWAYS be seen from above after I set them...easier to check them.  From all the mounds on our 2 acres, am guessing we have at least 40 gophers or more.  These traps will be busy and I\\'ll be keeping score.<br /><br />I give the trap 5 stars for effectiveness and 4 stars for the emptying issue.

We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.\": 1,\n",

Trapped a couple of moles in 24 hours and problem has gone away now.<br /><br />I did not like the manufacturer's instructions. I had to find out how to set it myself. Here is what I did:<br /><br />1. Armed the trapped with the safety clip on.<br />2. Found a straight area on the mole's runway<br />3. Flattened a straight part of the runway a couple of inches wider that trap by stepping on it<br />4. Used a putty knife as wide as the trap jaws and cut two lines perpendicular to the run. I widened the cuts a bit for the jaws to push trough the cut easily<br />5. I pushed the trap jaws in the cuts until the trigger tip just touched the top part of the grass.<br />6. Removed the safety clip<br /><br />You can protect the trap if you are like me and have neighbors with kids and/or dog by covering the trap with a large bucket and a heavy weight on top of it.\": 1,\n",

He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma\\'am, that\\'s too deep. Ain\\'t gonna kill nothin\\'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.<br /><br />He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don\\'t give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.<br /><br />Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.<br /><br />It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience.

       "         'Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don\\'t work.  Treating for grubs don\\'t work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don\\'t work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don\\'t follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don\\'t want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot\\'s width.  Don\\'t push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don\\'t have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn\\'t happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don\\'t catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn\\'t dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn\\'t going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don\\'t want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I\\'ve been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don\\'t get a mole in the first day, don\\'t panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it\\'s a highway though, doesn\\'t mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It\\'s not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it\\'s minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don\\'t build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don\\'t like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don\\'t hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I\\'ve had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn\\'t get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I\\'ll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I\\'m the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I\\'m sure my verbage isn\\'t right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that\\'s all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven\\'t been able to give a very good answer because I don\\'t have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won\\'t hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25\\'s comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn\\'t everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I\\'d get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn\\'t get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don\\'t hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I\\'ve read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn\\'t find this review helpful.

The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.<br /><br />I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address.

I used a 2 x 4 to prop the jaws of the trap open until I figured out how to set it. This trap was one of the few recommended by \"The Mole Man\" [...], whose web site it really great for learning about mole biology, habitat and how to control moles. Traps appear to be the only effective method. And this trap is certainly effective. I caught a mole the first night the trap was out and several more since.': 1,\n",

       "         'I\\'ve used two other types of traps besides this one: the plunger style (stabbing death from above) and the scissor style with foot activation (cut \\'em in half). Neither worked very well--the scissor/foot style frustrated me the most because you have to compress the springs using your foot after the trap is positioned, and if the soil is somewhat damp, the whole trap will just squash into the ground.<br /><br />After the snow melted I discovered that the moles had been hard at work in my yard. I set the Victor trap on what I believed to be one of the mole \"highways\" and caught a critter WITHIN 6 HOURS. He was a big one too, almost 6 inches from nose to tail.<br /><br />PROS of the Victor trap:<br />* I like that you can set/compress the trap before you place it. This makes it easy to position it exactly how you want it in the ground.<br />* The safety catch is a nice feature. If you hit the trigger lever by accident, you won\\'t hurt yourself.<br />* Trigger lever is VERY sensitive. This has been one of my frustrations with other traps--I can sometimes tell by the soil movement that moles are passing under it without tripping it.<br />* Price, $10 is cheaper than most other traps.<br /><br />CONS of the Victor trap:<br />* The instructions stink. Even disregarding the placement issue (see next point), it took me a few minutes to figure out how to compress the trap using the \"setting levers\" and trigger lever. It\\'s a good design, just not well documented.<br />* Don\\'t use the instructions on the box for placing the trap. I followed the advice of several other reviewers here who suggest cutting notches on either side of the tunnel for the trap blades to rest in. This turned out to be easier and more effective.<br /><br />If they just improved the instructions on the box, it\\'d be a five star review from me.': 1,\n",

I've read all the mumbo jumbo from the go green guys about how moles just eat grubs and help aerate the soil. Yeah right!

       "         'I\\'ve had at least one mole terrorizing my landscaping for about 8 months now.  I initially let him go, since he wasn\\'t actually damaging plants.  In time, though, he\\'d separated enough roots from the soil that I nearly lost several plants, and my 20 ft crabapple was dropping half its leaves in June.  Something had to be done.  I\\'d read the reviews here early on, but decided to try some control methods that I could get locally.  This trap was not one of those.<br />I used three of the Victor harpoon-style mole traps, and managed to get them triggered successfully, but the mole escaped.  The design is simply flawed--in pushing the harpoon downward, the trap tends to force itself out of the ground.  To help prevent this, the trap has very long stakes that need to be driven into the ground... if you have much gravel in your soil, like I do, this is nearly impossible.<br />Several states\\' university extensions have tested the relatively new gummy-worm style baits with reasonable success, so I decided to try them.  Because my moles \"highway\" tunnels were right next to my house under plastic, I was able to peel back the plastic and drop them right into the tunnels (the plastic made up the roof of the tunnels).  I checked them each day for two days and my mole was actually eating them.  I had to leave town for a week, and when I got back there had been no new mole activity, which was not normal for my busy guy. I figure the gummy worms did him in.<br />Unfortunately, another mole invaded about 2 weeks later--completely different habits, though--this one preferred the lawn over the landscaping beds.  I\\'d ordered these traps the same day I placed the gummy worms, so I set three Out O\\'Sight traps per the instructions given by other reviewers (NOT THE ONES PROVIDED).  In three days I had my new mole.<br />One additional method of locating active tunnels that I like to use is to poke a stick through the top of an existing tunnel that you suspect might be a \"highway\".  Place a stone over the hole to block out the light.  Check under the stone daily--if the hole is filled in, the mole has passed through again.  Set your trap there.<br />Given the choice, I prefer these traps over the baits for two reasons--no poisons in your yard to accidentally get your neighbor\\'s cat, and there\\'s a little mole body to confirm that you actually got him.  Just be prepared--the little critters are actually kinda cute.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with their habits, follow the instructions given by the others here, and be patient, and you\\'ll have your moles.': 1,\n",
       "         'Woo hoo!  I\\'m so excited to have caught a mole so quickly after setting the traps for the first time.  I purchased two traps and set them up like Geoffrey Klos suggested.  I couldn\\'t find any runs that looked like \"highways\", but I did find some that snaked around my yard and seemed to connect the myriad of smaller runs that branched out.  I guess my instincts were correct.  When I noticed that the trap had been set off, I took my shovel with me, fully prepared to whack that mole on its head if it were alive. I was not prepared for it to be so cute and fuzzy, so I now have a live mole in a bucket.  I guess that\\'s better than a live mole in my front yard.  The only problem is I now have to figure out how to get rid of the cute little monster.  Needless to say, the trap worked great.  The trap is probably best set with two people:  one to use the levers to open the jaws and the other to position the safety hook and the tripping rod.  I set it by myself in two steps.  First I layed it on its side and stepped on the top lever until I could lock the safety hook.  At that point, the levers were close enough together that I could squeeze them with one hand while setting the tripping rod and tripping pan. I noticed the pictures that looked like someone had dug two trenches in which to place the legs of the trap, but I just followed Klos\\'s instructions and used a small spade to make four puncture holes that lined up with the legs, and then I pressed the trap down into the holes until the tripping pan touched the dirt that I had previously patted down with my foot.

Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.

The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn\\'t). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I\\'m convinced there is no \"natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don\\'t give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!': 1,\n",
       "         \"I bought two of these two years ago.  First year I didn't need it since the moles left me alone.  This year however I have set it twice and caught a mole each time.  I'd previously tried other types of mole traps, i.e. spikes and hoops but with limited success.  (Seemes I had too many misses, sprung trap but no catches).  Having grown up on a farm and traping several types of critters I figured I knew how to trap moles too.  I felt strongly about this trap today after my second success in just two settings that I looked up my two year old purchase and wrote this.<br /><br />Aug. 19th, 2011<br />Mole #3 today.  So far I've made three sets and caught three moles.  Not a miss yet.  This type of trap is definately the best of any I've tried previously.\": 1,\n",
       "         'Looked all over and read many reviews. This trap just works! Got it this morning and put it in like the pictures show. Snap, one dead mole three hours later. Now to get the rest of the clan as well.': 1,\n",
       "         \"I chose this based on reviews.  It's not available locally in stores, and I learned that my mole problem would not be fixed using gopher/mole bait.<br /><br />This trap is fairly large.  It's all-metal with a VERY strong spring.  It's not the easiest thing to set, requiring a fair amount of force, and you need to be very careful with it.  If you catch a finger in it, I have no doubt you'd break it and you'd have a very difficult time trying to get out of it with only one working hand, so use care!!!<br /><br />The instructions could be a little more clear, but the trap is easy to figure out how it works once you examine it and set it once.  You do need to find a good location to set it, and make sure to create the mound in the middle that rests very closely to the trigger.  It only takes about 10 minutes to set once you figure it out.  I can probably do it under 5 minutes now.<br /><br />I suggest covering the trap with an upside down plastic pot with a weight on top to block out the light and to keep kids and other animals from accidentally getting into to it.  While the jaws will be below ground, it's still not something you'd want to trip or step on just in case.<br /><br />I set three of these traps along with 2 pairs of Trapline (check them out too... you'll have to search for them yourself... it's a California thing), not certain which would work and I was quite determined to get rid of my mole problem ASAP once it (or they) dug over 20 holds in my new lawn in 2 days.  The next morning... already caught the mole!  It was trap cleanly around the hips.  It wasn't a bloody mess at all, but it probably died from a combination of internal injuries, a broken spine, and asphyxiation.  Regardless, it was VERY dead.<br /><br />Bottom line... this trap is EFFECTIVE.  And that's the best I could ask for.  I probably have an overkill of traps, but I have extensive tunneling in my yard and wanted to catch the mole quickly before it did more damage.  I LOVE this trap and highly recommend it!\": 1,\n",
       "         'As many other reviewers, I had tried pellets, castor oil repellent, giant smoke bombs (two packages), and a sonic mole chaser to no avail. Every morning during the summer I would surely wake up to fresh mole hills and pebbles on our front yard, and I was losing the war. Then I purchased the Out of Sight trap on Amazon based on reviews and because it was available through Amazon Prime. Also, surprisingly no mole traps were available at my local Home Depot and OSH stores.<br /><br />After placing the trap in three different locations over the span of a week, I finally nailed the bugger. Here are some tips that I learned on my own or from various sites on the Internet:<br /><br />(1) Many of the reviewers on Amazon said that they encountered only shallow mole runs that were visible on the surface. They cited a good technique to set the trap for the shallow runs. However, my mole burrowed only deep runs. No runs were visible from the surface; only the mole hills. To set the trap for the deep runs, I followed the directions on the box, which called for digging a hole along a main run. I had to dig around 6 inches to get down to the run. Then, just as the directions say, I created a \"speed bump\" and filled the hole with some very loose soil. Then I placed a large 39 oz coffee can on top of the hole and trap. In fact, the coffee can made for a good template to carve out the hole, which should not be much wider in diameter than the length of the trap.<br /><br />(2) I found out on some website (I don\\'t recall which) that when you first get the Out of Sight trap that you should stick it in dirt for a couple of days so that the odor of the freshly machined trap metal, which the mole can apparently smell, gets diffused. I don\\'t know if that is fact or fiction, but my first unsuccessful experience with the trap seems to support that theory. The mole kicked dirt into the hole where I first placed the trap and also plugged up the runs leading to the trap. Smart little critter!<br /><br />(3) I found that a good tool to locate the main runs was a weed remover. The tip of the weed remover is thin enough to poke into the turf, but thick enough to have you sense whether you are still poking through dirt, which may be loose, or have discovered a run. Keep in mind that the main runs are still only around 1-1/2\" in diameter. The key to placing the trap is to find an active, main run.<br /><br />(4) If you have deep mole runs (like I experienced), a good way to locate them is to draw a straight line between adjacent, new mole hills. There is a good likelihood that there is a run that connects the mole hills. Place the trap between the adjacent mole hills, but more than 18 inches away from either mole hill. If you place the trap within close proximity to a mole hill, you will invariably just get dirt thrown into the trap by the mole.<br /><br />(5) Once a mole is trapped, you may get another mole (or some other critter) moving into its place. Moles are individualists. They stay away from other moles, but take over a territory when there is no other mole present. Moles do, however, get together in the spring when they mate. So, even after a kill, stay attentive to your lawn.<br /><br />In conclusion, I attest to this trap and its quality. It should last a long, long time. I would not allow my wife or a child to use the trap, however. As others noted, the spring is heavy duty and takes a fair amount of strength and courage to set. Also, it can be dangerous, and a set trap needs to be handled very carefully and with the safety latch on.<br /><br />Now that I got my mole, I can wake up without the anticipation of me having to rake over mole hills and replug grass. Also, now that I am confident about using the trap (I have one kill under my belt!), I am assured that if another bugger shows up (and one surely will), I know how to effectively deal with it.': 1,\n",
       "         \"Wow, I am impressed.  Read all the reviews and thought this trap sounded like a good bet for my mole woes.  Put 3 into the ground following other's tips and caught a mole in 5 MINUTES!!!  I kid you not.  By the time I put the shovel away, took off my shoes, and looked out my window one of the traps had sprung.  I thought it was because I put it in wrong!  Nope, dead mole - right there in the trap.  These things rule!\": 1,\n",
       "         \"I purchased several of the Victor 0631 mole traps and have had great success with trapping the moles that have been tearing up our yard. The spring on it is massive, which gives the trap enough strength to cut through any type of soil conditions when it is triggered. The trap is much easier to set if you use a large pair of channel lock pliers. You will want to use caution when handling the the loaded trap - once it is set, you don't want to get anywhere near the jaws, as it will be a guaranteed visit to the hospital. I also use the channel lock pliers to put the trap in position over the mole tunnel to give myself plenty of distance from the moving parts. I have also tried the Nash Choker Loop and the Sweeney Plunger trap. I catch about 3 moles with the Victor trap for every one that I get with the Nash trap. In damp sandy soil, I have seen the Nash trap not being able to trip quick enough because the spring doesn't quite have the oomph behind it to cut through the dirt. As far as the Sweeney trap goes, I have yet to get my first mole after 3 years of using it.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"After reading some of the reviews, it seems like a lot of people have had success with these traps, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was still skeptical, because that's my nature, but I'm not anymore. I installed the trap using the method of stepping on the mole tunnel to flatten it and cutting slits in the grass for the trap's scissors. The very next day I noticed the trap had tripped and I went to see if I caught one. Sure enough, when I pulled the trap out, there was the bane of my yard. A big, fat, ugly sucker with huge claws designed for yard devastation. I felt a little bad because I love most animals, but this one deserved what he got. Anyway, these traps are awesome. I cannot believe how good they work. Happy hunting.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"I didn't have high expectations for this but it worked so I'll share what I did:<br /><br />I stamped down ALL of the tunnels in the yard the evening before.  The next morning I looked for new tunnel, especially long straight ones because apparently those are the ones most travelled.  I then placed the trap on said tunnel and I had a dead mole within two hours.  Like a previous reviewer, I did not follow the manufacturers instructions and instead followed his which I reccomend doing because it's not only easier but also works.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"You must find the mole 'highways' which are the long straight runs that (for me) were easiest found beside the patio, sidewalk, or driveway.  Once you think you have identified one, simply mash down about a 2 foot long section.  My thought process was that if I pressed down the entire run, they might find an alternate route.<br /><br />So once you do this, check back in 24-48 hours to see if has been repaired.  If it has, then mash down a section the length of your foot, LEVEL with the rest of the surrounding grounds.  I have sand soil so I simply dug (with my finger) 2 small notches ACROSS the mole highway same distance apart as the trap death grips.<br /><br />I found it easy to set the trap by hand, using the directions on the box... but many other reviews here offer alternative methods.  Leave the 2 bars used to pry the trap open in place, it helps to position the trap in the ground.  Now, set the trap death grips down in the notches you have created (with SAFETY latch hooked!) The trigger plate should touch the LEVEL ground that you mashed down.  Keep a firm grip on the pry bars as the trap may trigger a few times until you get it touching the ground with light enough pressure not to trigger.  When you are happy, remove the pry bars, release the safety and enjoy the results.<br /><br />Start > Finish, of setting trap, maybe 3 minutes.<br /><br />My soil is pure sand, so my 'notches' mentioned above were almost non-existent because they kept back filling with sand as soon as I dug them out with my finger.  When I set the trap, the soil was in between the death grips, but it was loose enough to grab the mole, first night I had set the trap!<br /><br />Great trap, easy to use and set.  I may have had some beginners luck, but so far so good.\": 1,\n",
       "         'I bought these a few months ago... finally got around to using them this week.  Trapped one mole within 24 hours.  I just bought two more traps.  I am going to deploy all four and see what I get next.  Also caught a vole with regular mouse traps... thanks to these Victor traps I am hopefully on my way to ridding my yard of piles of dirt (moles) and chewed up grass and plants (voles), and saving the hundreds of dollars a service would charge for this... it is so simple.': 1,\n",
       "         'I have recurring mole problems, lost count how many years now. Tried many things, but only this \"Out of Sight\" worked. This is my story:<br />1) First encounter years ago, surprise, what\\'s up with these bumps?<br />2) Just tidy up the surface. Never mind that.<br />3) Ran water down the tunnel until water came out the other end. Very satisfying, but just a waste of water. Made the whole place muddy and the creature liked it even more.<br />4) Invested in a plunger type trap. Expensive and reusable, sounded good. Not quite. I was excited the first time it triggered, got my gloves on and plastic bag ready. The spikes went down a couple inches, but no catch. Tried a few more times with the same result. Even tied bricks on the top half, but the trap became unbalanced and did not plunge well. Trashed it.<br />5) Poison \"peanut\". Do not like poisons, but maybe just for this one. Carefully dropped nuts into tunnels as directed. No noticable result, but creature was gone late fall. Used it again early next season, at which time I concluded that it did not work. The creature likes worms and bugs, not deadly smelling chemical.<br />6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap\\'s frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5\" tunnel.<br />7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.<br />8) Lastly, the \"Out of Sight\". The size of the spring alone is impressive - WARNING: bone crushing spring force! Even my normally curious coworkers refused to play with it when my order arrived at the office. Set trap as directed the first night. At 3:30AM, a snap woke me up; continued to sleep, but with a smile on my face. The next morning, voila, face to face for the first time.<br /><br />I have a video of this last episode, may upload it later.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel \"flavorable\" by keeing it moist between watering.<br />2) Creature works day and night, just not when you are looking.<br />3) Size your creature. Mine (I live in SoCal) turned out to be small like a fresh sausage. It explains why my pitch fork missed and the wire trap was too big.': 1,\n",
       "         \"Update June 3, 2011<br />More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.<br /><br />Original review<br />Five hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.<br /><br />I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.<br /><br />I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.<br /><br />The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.<br /><br />My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.<br /><br />It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.<br /><br />I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.<br /><br />I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.\": 1,\n",

But, after reading some of the reviews here for the other Victor Out O\\' Sight trap, I realized I wasn\\'t setting them right.  And, I caught one mole yesterday, and another today.  So, I\\'m excited that I\\'ve finally come up with a way to catch them.<br /><br />I\\'m sharing my technique for setting them in the hope it will help you:<br />  1) Find an active tunnel.  You can just walk around the yard and step down on raised areas, then come back later and see if they get raised up again.<br />  2) Cut a couple of scrap pieces of wood that are 3/8\" or 1/2\" thick by four or five inches long, by say, five or six inches high. You\\'ll use these to hold the grooves you cut for the trap legs when you push down on the soil.<br />  4) Get a garden tool that can cut down through any roots, like a hatchet, or a flat-blade tool with wooden shaft and a handle (don\\'t know what you call it, but that\\'s what I use).<br />  5) Get a tool you can use to find the center of the tunnel.  I use a discarded mop handle that I drilled a hole in the end of and glued in a six inch nail.<br />  6) Probe the tunnel to approximately locate it\\'s center, and just leave it sticking in the center for now.<br />  7) Set the trap on the ground along the tunnel near where you will place it so you can see how far apart to cut the grooves for the trap legs.<br />  8) Cut the first groove for the trap legs as clean as you can; then, feel down in the cut line to locate the tunnel. Use a finger to locate the tunnel.<br />  9) Stick one of your scrap pieces of wood in this groove, and tap it down firmly.<br />  10) Then cut the other groove so the other legs will go in it.<br />  11) Again, run a finger down in this cut to locate the other end of the tunnel.  You do this because the tunnel may turn some, and you\\'ll need to turn your trap too.<br />  12) Stick the other scrap piece of wood in it.<br />  11) Now, step down with your heel between the two pieces of scrap wood. You want this dirt to be very firm.  I do this, then also tap down with the end of my flat blade tool to get it extra firm.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />  12) Next, wiggle the two pieces of wood back and forth, and in and out to open up the two grooves a little, them pull them out.<br />  13) Set the trap into the two grooves while observing the clearance between the ground and the traps bottom lever. You don\\'t want it to contact the ground or you\\'ll spring the trap.  Incidentally, you should have the trap safety ON at this point.<br />  14) Now, use a finger to feel the clearance between the ground and the lever; and, push and/or tap the trap down slowly until it is only 1/16th inch or so from the ground.<br />  15) Release the trap\\'s safety.  I repeat: Release the trap\\'s safety.  I seem to frequently forget to do this.<br />  16) Take some loose soil or leaves and just drop them around the trap legs to prevent sunlight from getting down to the tunnel.<br />  17) GOOD LUCK!': 1,\n",

One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard.

Watch where the earth is lifted up again, these are active tunnels. Try to find straight runs, these are called \"runways\". Anything else are feeding tunnels and they come through these only infrequently. A good indicator are actual mole-hills. This is where the deeper tunnels start (their living room, basically).

Mr. Klos' method probably would work best if I had not spent the summer smashing down the mole runs. They just dug deeper tunnels. Common sense and a little exploration told me the Klos method would put the squeezers ABOVE the tunnel.  But, other reviews told that, once they figured out that the poor instructions on the package were for deeper tunnels, they were successful. All my tunnels were too deep to use the Klos method.<br /><br />So, I dug up each main run and cleaned out each end of the tunnel to find the common middle ground.  I built a hard mound in the center of the open space.  I loaded the trap and put the safety on.  I placed the trap directly on top of the mound, with the spring barely touching the mound.  It was good I kept the safety on until I buried the trap because a couple times I put it so far down the spring sprung.<br /><br />So, which way is best?  The method that puts the bottom of the trap at the bottom of the run. Don't smash the tunnels down; then, the trap can be placed on the top of the ground merely by inserting two slits in a main run.  I followed the seller's instructions and it worked for deeper runs. Next year, the runs will be trapped without being stomped down first.  Happy hunting.\": 1,\n",

Poison pellets, poison worms, spike trap, smoke bombs, scoot mole...All of these I've tried and, if they worked, it sure wasn't noticeable to me. At my wit's end, I called a professional service two months ago to control the mole problem. For $180, for one month of service, they placed 6 of these very same traps. The problem is, they came every week to check on the traps. So, one month later and one mole later (an additional $35 for removal of the dead mole), they yanked the traps. Well, one dead mole was better than my previous record of zero and I couldn't possibly justify spending another $180 + $35 for each dead mole for this service, so I ordered four of my own.<br /><br />The day I received them, one month ago, I placed all of them out along runs that, of course, magically popped up when the service had terminated. That very evening, while out on the patio, we heard a snap. The trap I had placed on the main run coming from the woods had caught one heading in the direction of my yard. The next day I removed the traps and stamped down all the runs. Around a week later, I spotted more runs so I placed the traps again. The next morning, I had another one. I waited a day or so, pulled the traps and stamped down the runs. The next time I saw runs was this past weekend. I placed all the traps again around 3pm. About 2 hours later (no, I'm not exaggerating), I had another mole. I pulled that trap, but left the others behind. The next morning another trap was full.

In my opinion, this is the best solution out there to keep moles from destroying your yard. The advice I have regarding these traps is to make sure to buy enough traps to cover all the runs and increase your odds of trapping a mole. Additionally, be sure to be vigilant for the runs. At first sign, deploy your traps as you will likely increase the odds of trapping a mole in a run that was just made versus a run that is days old. Lastly, to deploy your traps successfully: 1)Find a relatively straight run (not those windy, loopy runs) 2)Stamp down just over a trap-width of the run with your foot 3)Set the trap and push it into the ground straddling the stamped-down run until the catch touches the ground 4)Enjoy the satisfaction of knowing, after you pull out your first sprung trap and the bane of your existence is dangling from the claws of the trap, that you just saved yourself years of frustration (and money!) by simply buying a few of these traps.

I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it.

       "         'Another mole hunter from St Louis here. I have tried everything: pellets, smoke bombs, different poisons, flooding the holes, a pretty useless trap sold in Lowes and Home Depot (I did get one mole last year with this but it\\'s very weak and flimsy. I think I was lucky). A friend of mine told me she was fed up and was going to pay a professional to catch her moles. He caught 2 of them in a couple of weeks and she hasn\\'t had a problem since. I asked her if she could figure out what kind of trap he used. Well, this is the one!<br /><br />Since I bought these traps a few months ago, I have caught 5 moles (that includes 1 for my neighbor). Despite having caught 4 moles in my front and back yards, there is still new  activity from time to time. I think they cover the whole neighborhood. I have some traps in my yard and a couple in my neighbor\\'s across the street. I have purchased 6 traps (they are a great price and VERY sturdy) and I\\'m about to purchase 2 more to send to my in-laws.<br /><br />The way I have found these work for me is as follows:<br />1. Try to pick out a tunnel that looks like a common route or \"freeway.\" For me, it\\'s usually close to a path or driveway where they have hit the \"wall\" and work their way along it. Don\\'t stomp all the raised tunnels down unless there are so many you need to find a place to start.<br />2. By keeping the tunnel open and just pushing down the dirt in the area you intend to place the trap, the next time the mole comes by he will just start digging his way right into the trap. I like to keep the soil pretty loose where the trap is going to be placed so when the ground gets hard and baked, the trap will still be able to spring shut quickly. Just make sure the holes on both sides of the trap are covered. The dirt in the compressed area is usually about an inch or less below the rest of the ground.<br />3. Remember to use the safety catch when placing the trap in the ground. You want to make sure the flat base of the trap, (the part the mole will push up when he tunnels to trigger the trap) is well set in the ground and the four spikes in the ground are on either sides of the tunnel. It may be a little difficult to set the trap but it\\'s not THAT hard to do. Come on!<br />4. Be patient. The first time I set a trap I had a mole in less than twelve hours. The last one I caught was in a trap in my garden which I had set 3 weeks earlier. Of course if you see new activity in a different area, you may want to move the trap. Trial and error.<br /><br />****Somebody else claimed these traps are hard to set. Yes, the springs on them are very strong and it takes a little elbow grease. The trap does come with tools to help you set the trap. If it wasn\\'t this strong I may as well use the useless trap from Lowes.': 1,\n",
       "         'This trap has been so effective that it has almost taken the challenge out of trapping moles in my yard.  I had tried other types of traps and was disappointed with the results. I\\'ve put my other experiences at the end if you are interested.<br /><br />As with any trap, it must be set in an active tunnel and it took a couple attempts to learn to set the Out O Sight.  However, once learned and active tunnels found, I have a 100% tripped trap/dead mole ratio.  As several others have said, following the directions sets the trap too deep.  On the other hand, the method described in other reviews here was too shallow to work for me.<br /><br />I have a recently re-graded yard with new topsoil trucked in so the soil is still fairly loose.  The top of most of the mole tunnels are about 3-4\" deep.  Pushing the tunnel down and setting the trap on top without digging down proved too shallow.<br /><br />The technique that has worked for me is similar to that on the box, but not quite as deep as described.  Carefully excavate a section of the tunnel as wide as the trap and as deep as the bottom of the tunnel without disrupting the structure of the bottom half of the tunnel ... the bottom half of the walls and the floor.  Then take a few clumps of the dirt (it has been very wet here since starting to trap) and put them in the tunnel between where the claws of the trap will go.  Don\\'t pack it tight, just drop them in.  Set the trap with the claws slightly deeper than the bottom of the tunnel by pressing it in.  The trip pan should sit on the clumps you put in.  Put the remainder of the soil back around the tunnel opening you made and around the trap to block out the light.  Do your best not to disrupt the tunnel leading up to the trap\\'s jaws and don\\'t pack it too tighly.  You want the mole to be in the jaws before encountering blockage.<br /><br />I have been holding the trip pan down while pushing the trap to the desired depth so I don\\'t accidentally set it off and then making sure the release side of the trip pan is not tight against the soil which would possibly prevent it from springing.<br /><br />Since starting in November, the count is 10 with 3 of them in the last week.  Most of the time I have my quarry within 12 hours of setting the trap .  The time it will take is directly dependent on finding an actively used tunnel.  I patrol my yard almost every day and get the trap in immediately after finding a new tunnel.<br /><br />I have docked the device one star because the jaw of one of the first two traps I bought inexplicably cracked.  Also because I think it could be easier to set, but practice makes perfect. (use caution)  Despite this, the trap has been so effective and much less expensive than the alternatives that I have purchased 3 additional traps to replace the broken one and the other traps I have purchased that were not effective.<br /><br /> Plunging spear type:  Anchoring seemed to be an issue as well as spring strength to reach the mole in the heavy clay soil here.  The trap would be tripped, but no mole under it.<br /> Trapline in-tunnel wire trap:  A device that is genius in its simplicity and would likely do well in dryer soil than I was trying to trap in.  My experience was the moles digging around the device.  Perhaps I just didn\\'t master setting it.  I also didn\\'t like having to dig up the trap to see if it was tripped.<br /> Poison pellets:  Not sure if the moles took them or not.  Worked too slowly to stop the damage, so a worthless approach in my mind.': 1,\n",

But, to this point, the moles are having the last laugh.  The trap has failed to catch a single tunnel builder.<br /><br />The \"trap\" has sprung once in the weeks I\\'ve had it set. I could barely contain my excitement as I wrenched it from the tunnel, only to find that all it contained was a large clump of bermuda grass.<br /><br />My wife is belittling me for my purchase of this device.

Looking over the fence and repeatedly telling her, \"Not yet\" is getting embarrassing.<br /><br />It seems the moles are on to me.  Each time I set the trap they alter their route(s).  As soon as I move the trap, they return to their old tunnel(s).  It\\'s becoming a game to both of us.  I WILL WIN THIS GAME.<br /><br />I ain\\'t giving up.

I carefully installed one of the new victor traps in a feeding run.

I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.

At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs.

The trap has a very strong spring as is more than capable of squishing moles with ease.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Do not bother with the enclosed prongs.  The trap is easy to set if you use some creativity.  Drop the trap onto the grass (not dirt or pavement) and step on the jaws to get them shut in order to set the lever.  You have to use your body weight to do this.  Some people have said these traps are difficult to set.  They are a piece of cake to set if you do it this way.<br /><br />If the tunnel is on the surface, just use a knife (like a drywall knife) to make the slits in the ground and insert the legs of the trap.  Of course you will have to squish a small amount of tunnel down for the trigger to be right next to the earth.<br /><br />If the tunnel is a few inches down, dig a small section of the tunnel out (like 6 inches), place the trap inside, and fill it with loose soil.  The moles with try to make their way through the tunnel but will inevitably push up slightly on the trigger, causing their most unfortunate death.  Occassionally they will still be alive so be prepared for angry moles!

She\\'s really good at digging huge holes in the yard....but not actually catching anything.<br /><br />As one reviewer wrote, \"You are looking for long straight runs.

       "         'First of all, do not follow the instructions in the box. Instead read some of these reviews for very good tips.<br />I got two moles in about five days. It took me a little bit to learn where and how to set it. I pretty much followed the good advise given in other post, I recommend you do the same, their method works.<br />Before this trap I tried a bunch of less-aggressive methods but to no avail. It is really hard to get rid of moles in a nice way. Finally I got fed up and went for a trap. Also, with a trap you can see the body of the critter and know for sure that you got it.<br />The trap has a simple-but-effective design, it is built of solid, black-painted iron and it is bigger and tougher than what I thought it was going to be from the product pictures, but it is not huge. The spring is very strong and I have to put my weight on it (using the provided levers) to set it (remember to use the locking hook).<br />The triggering mechanism is simple and reliable, although I used a file to round the edge of the holding \"stick\" to make it slide out easier of the trigger piece (added sensitivity) but be careful not to over-do it! or it will trigger by itself.<br />The trap stays out-of-sight in my backyard because it lays low and it is black. I added a bunch of tree leaves on top of it to make it invisible. The leaves don\\'t interfere with its functioning.<br />The most difficult thing about setting this trap is placement. I\\'m still learning where is the most likely tunnel that the mole is going to use. I\\'m using little construction flags to mark tunnels that I step on to find out which tunnels are the most active.<br />One if the moles that it caught was still alive when I checked the trap, so bring a shovel with you in case you need it.<br />Also the price is very good compared to other very expensive traps.<br />I highly recommend this trap.': 1,\n",

It would be better suited to going under the bed.<br /><br />Second, the main difference between the 2 traps is the amount of open space for fleas to get trapped. This trap has a large open space to catch more fleas, and the Spingstar has a smaller grid that traps less fleas. The trade off is, the Springstar is more aesthetically pleasing. That trap hides the trapped fleas better under a grid piece, and kids and pets can't get to the sticky pad. With this trap smaller children could easily reach inside, so again, something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Third, when assembling this trap the sticky pad was curved in the box. This meant that the pad refused to lay flat in the trap. A small problem that could be fixed with tape if need be.<br /><br />Overall this trap is a good investment. I have had it set up for a little over a week now and have caught 2 adult fleas and gnats. This is a cost effective way to see if you have your flea infestation under control while not using chemicals. Since adult fleas can emerge from pupas months after an infestation it's far better to lure them to a trap to die then let them bite your animals.<br /><br />If you're choosing between this and the Springstar it boils down to a matter of personal preference. If you plan to leave the trap out for people to see, go with the Spingstar. If you want a large, industrial type trap, go with this one.

I caught about 20 fleas on the first pad before it stopped being sticky. I could have caught many more fleas if the glue hadn\\'t dried up. It doesn\\'t dry real fast. I suppose it was about a month before I discovered that the pad wasn\\'t sticky anymore. In the meantime I was still using it to catch fleas, thinking that it was still working. But it had dried up. Besides this, I\\'d like it if the manufacturer redesigned the trap so that it snapped closed more securely. The way it is now, the top can easily be knocked off, exposing the glue pad.

Do not spray pet bedding - wash it instead.  Smell is too strong for animals.<br /><br />Vacuum your house as if your life depended on it!!  Vacuum floors, carpets, crevices, mattresses, under cabinets, etc.  Throw away vacuum bag at end of first vacuum, then weekly.  spray Ultracide inside vacuum bag to kill fleas as they hatch and store vacuum outside your house.<br /><br />Spray house and yard with Talstar using a 2-3 gal pump sprayer like Chapin.  Mix and spray.  Kills all bugs outside too!  Do not spray flowers or edibles.  Spray perimeter of house, driveway, cracks in concrete, ant hills, etc.  Avoid earthworms.  Repeat in one week to kill hatchling fleas.  Let dry before letting pets back in.  Has no smell.<br /><br />Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.<br /><br />Wash animals with Eqyss Microtek Shampoo and Eqyss Premiere Conditioner. Give dogs Comfortis orally once a month.  Give cats Revolution applied to skin once a month.<br /><br />On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.<br /><br />This should eliminate fleas for 6 months till the next spraying.  I spray 2 times per year and keep my animals on monthly flea meds plus Nitenpyram as needed.': 1,\n",

Everyone should use them, they work.<br /><br />Pros - I've killed literally thousands of flies.  Gallons of flies. Eventually I think I'll manage to wipe out the local breeding population and get ahead of the curve.  Trick is to start early in the spring - what one is really trying to achieve is population control not just killing a few flies.  Otherwise (depending on your landscape of course) the neighbors flies will just move in.  Bottom line if you use it according to the directions this flytrap works extremely well.  Many of the negative reviews here clearly didn't read the directions.  It really needs to be in sunlight.<br /><br />Cons - it reeks.  Seriously.  I can't imagine anyone using this inside their house - when it gets going you don't really want to be within 20 feet of it.  Unbelievably strong smell of rotting garbage. And though it's theoretically reusable, you are unlikely to do so unless you have a really strong stomach.  Think a big jar of rotting dead and half dead flies.  It's really foul.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you use it properly - think some form of perimeter defense, with targeting of fly hot spots like garbage cans with loose lids, you can make your world fly free.  If you have really few flies, one jar properly located will take care of them, but you should actually spend some time analyzing what you need.<br /><br />Anecdotally and by observation, btw, this seems like the most effective fly trap on the market\": 1,\n",

The white cat is recent addition to our neighborhood, and seemed pleasant at first, but then I saw him peeing right in the middle of an agapanthys in the garden, and since then, I dislike him as much as Monkey does.  Since Pocket died, we have not had a flea problem, which is a blessing.  Not Pocket dying because we miss her, even though we no longer have to block access to the pantry with a 5 gallon pail of expired mayonnaise (A national brand, no less, but I won\\'t mention the name as it is known, either East or West of the Rockies) but the part about not having the fleas.  But for some reason, we have had an abundance of black house flies.  I always tell Monkey \"look, you let your big black buddies in again,\" and \"Stop letting your big black buddies in.\"  She is not persuaded by this and only rarely seems to patrol the window sills for dying flies like the dog we had when I was little did.  (Dog\\'s name, Princess Leia.)  I bought some kind of insecticide at Big Lots, two kinds, and though one or both actually harness the power to kill houseflies, neither is the light aerosol type that is effective for spraying on flies.  One left a wet mess all over my office, and the other was a white powder which only served to crud up the carpet and attract undesirable teenagers to my apartment.  I recalled that one of my school teachers hanging a jar with a piece of steak in it to catch flies in the goat pens.  Armed with this information, I acquired the Victor M380 Fly Magnet 1-Quart Reusable Trap With Bait.  I was pleased that I did not have to supply my own steak, as I am vegetarian, and would have to have borrowed some from the neighbor.  It is difficult to imagine how I would explain what the piece of steak was for and I am really not certain at all if any of my neighbors would want me to return it when i was done using it.  I mean, I get along with my neighbors really well, including the ones who rent a large Dora The Explorer bouncey house for every imaginable event, and they are rather nice about letting us get in there even after we have had a heavy lunch and it\\'s ill-advised.  (Veggie corn-dogs with relish and lots of cole slaw and grape soda just do not look good painted all over the inside of a bouncey house.  Not even the Spongebob one.)  I carefully read the instructions, and added the recommended amount of water, more or less, with the enclosed packet of fly attractant.  The fly attractant looks a bit like what comes out of a packet of guacamole mix or taco seasoning, but I suspect is freeze dried meat and dog poo, or poo of some sort, perhaps horse or pig.  I hung the jar prominently in the middle of the front garden from the decorative plant hanger that I bought at big lots several years ago, which despite being some sort of sturdy metal when I bought it, has become flimsy with age and bends easily, but not weighed down too much by the fly trap jar.  I thought no more about the trap until my mate mentioned it.  The other morning when I came home from work just after sunrise I stood very close to the trap and looked at the mass of struggling near dead flies bogging themselves down in the mire of poo water now filled with dead comrades.  I stared at it for quite some time, set aglow by the distinct rays of the rising sun.  I stared at it until I was rather tired.  I stared at it until I realized that there is a rather unpleasant looking fungus spreading in the garden, up the bases of the sago palms.  I kicked the fungi around.  I went to bed.  I have considered the humiliation and disgust that someone wold feel if I were to pour the contents of the jar on someone.  I am certain the manufacturers would strongly advise against this.  I am not recommending you do that.  I am recommending the Victor M380 Fly Magnet 1-Quart Reusable Trap With Bait.  It has really cleared up the fly problem in just a matter of a week.

In each case, after a few hours, the trap is surrounded by a swarm of flies practically going frantic to get inside.  They are ordinary house flies.  The numbers are shocking - they must be coming in from all over the county.<br /><br />The plastic bottle, screw-on lid, and little roof are quite rugged and would probably last indefinitely.  The unit comes with a length of wire that works nicely for hanging it from a ceiling fixture or small tree branch.<br /><br />The bait is a powder that you mix with water.  The smell is quite foul, rather like - well, you know what flies enjoy sitting on most.  It's definitely for outdoor use, although with ventilation you might place it in the garage or shed.<br /><br />My experience indicates it is wise to empty the bottle before it fills up completely with dead flies, living flies, and maggots.  This will be a disgusting task and the stink will be formidable - not something you'll want to do near the house.\": 1,\n",

Now, I'm not so dumb as to think I could use these inside the house, but I thought inside the garage might work. The bait when mixed in warm water doesn't initially have much of a strong oder.<br />I put a trap in the garage and had no catches within a couple of hours, even though the garage was buzzing with critters. I then moved the trap outside, about 20 feet from the open door. That day I had several flys trapped. The next day I had even more. The trapping accelerated each day until on about day five I had a layer of 1+ inch of dead flys in the trap jar. Unfortunately, the stench of rotting flesh was now detectable at about 50 yards away, downwind. It appears that the bait is only to get the trapping started, and it's the dead flys that really draw more flys in. At this point I had to get rid of the stench; I could either bury the god-awful mess, or pour it into the sewer system (my choice). I then employed two traps with the same smelly results. I again used the two traps but started with left-over canned cat food (in water) as the bait. The cat food seemed to do as good as the purchased bait, and the end results were again the same.<br />After thinking it over, the removal of several dozens of outside flys that are immediately replaced from the countless numbers existing in the environment is hardly worth the trouble (and smell) of using the fly traps.\": 1,\n",

The day of the party, the cake tastes great - no detection of colorant bitterness, but 2-day old cake will seem to have a strange taste, maybe the color finally settling in.  The colors are great, and because they are dropper bottles, you can control the amount - they are very concentrated pigments, so one drop will do wonders.  If you want really dark colors, you will probably achieve it with just a few drops, but beware, it will, like other colorants, stain your countertop, fingers, tongue, skin, so plan on it and protect your counters, etc.  We are used to this, but obviously, wipe spills quickly.

It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.<br /><br />If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow.

       "         'The \"ad\" for the product said a package of 12 ice creams.  I received one.<br />Not happy about that but too frustrating to try to track down the seller, fight with him/her and just gave up.<br />So upsetting.': 1,\n",
       "         'Just received our box and all 10 Ice Cream Sandwiches are present and accounted for.  They feel broken in the packages (seems they were already broken when packed - not a result of shipping) but since you break them up to eat them anyway I don\\'t mind at all.  They are great!  Taste just like a \"real\" ice cream sandwich!': 1,\n",
       "         \"The blocks i received were broken up into small pieces. You have to break it up to eat i any how so it didn't matter to me. I when to NASA as a kid and fell in love with this stuff. I like sharing it with my family now.\": 1,\n",
       "         \"I like all of the Astronaut Ice Cream flavors, especially the Ice Cream Sandwich.<br />The vanilla ice cream tastes very creamy.<br />The sandwich was broken a little, but it made it easier to eat.<br />It's fun to pretend to be an Astronaut!\": 1,\n",
       "         'I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my \"real\" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.': 1,\n",
       "         'STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE.': 1,\n",
       "         'Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don\\'t have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they\\'re mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they\\'re vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.': 1,\n",
       "         'Based upon the various reviews I decided to give this a try as we normally use Starbucks Espresso pods. I have to say that the taste of Espressione is much more bland and the coffee tastes weaker.': 1,\n",
       "         'Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon, I have produced delicious lattes using these pods. The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \"tab\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you\\'re going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \"best if used by\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.': 1,\n",
       "         'These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.<br /><br />Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee & these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.<br /><br />What more could a person want?!': 1,\n",
       "         'I returned this due to the very short/brief expiration date, Sept \\'03. That would be less than 3-months to use up all 150 pods. Amazon should pull this \"off the shelves\"!': 1,\n",
       "         \"I can't say enough good things about the Espressione pods. They are of the highest quality and the product is fresh, fresh, fresh! If you've ever wondered if pre-packaged espresso can taste as good as freshly ground, wonder no more. The Espressione pods are--to my palate, at least--indistinguishable from fresh ground beans. Yep, they really are that good!\": 1,\n",
       "         \"For years I have been trying to simulate a truly Italian espresso or cappuccino without success.  Several packages arrived [...] just before Christmas.  My son had sent a Briel Cadiz Espresso machine, two lovely Russian china cups and a case of Espressione Classic Espresso Pods.  It was the kindest, most wonderful Christmas present I can remember.  The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.  Each time I prepare an espresso or cappuccino I experience my son's loving kindness and a small part of the many gifts of Italy.  Heaven on Earth.\": 1,\n",
